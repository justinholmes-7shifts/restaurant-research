- **Name:** Jason Lovelady
- **Title:** General Manager
- **Location:** Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen - Dallas North Tollway
- **LinkedIn:** [Profile Available](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-lovelady-aab9919/)

### KEY TALKING POINTS:

**OPENING (Pain Recognition):**
"I've been researching high-performing seafood restaurants in Dallas, and I noticed Pappadeaux Dallas North Tollway has been consistently hiring across multiple positions. Many similar high-volume restaurants we work with face challenges managing schedules for large teams, especially with variable demand on weekends and holidays..."

**SPECIFIC PAIN POINTS TO REFERENCE:**
1. **Turnover Reduction:** "We've helped similar high-volume restaurants reduce turnover by 30-40% through better schedule communication and shift flexibility..."

2. **Scheduling Efficiency:** "Our clients typically save 8-10 hours per week on scheduling admin and eliminate the back-and-forth of schedule changes and time-off requests..."

3. **Employee Satisfaction:** "Servers and hosts consistently rate schedule flexibility as a top factor in job satisfaction. Our platform gives employees visibility and control over their schedules..."

4. **Labor Cost Management:** "For a $10M+ revenue restaurant like yours, even a 2-3% improvement in labor efficiency can mean $200K-300K in annual savings..."

**PROOF POINTS TO EMPHASIZE:**
- Integration with existing POS systems
- Mobile-first for ease of use (critical for high-turnover environment)
- Shift-swapping features (addresses their "find your own coverage" problem)
- Manager approval workflows (addresses favoritism concerns)
- Automated scheduling based on sales forecasts (for weekend/holiday peaks)

### DISCOVERY QUESTIONS:

1. "How many hours per week does your management team spend creating schedules and handling schedule changes?"
2. "What's your current average tenure for front-of-house staff?"

### TIMING CONSIDERATIONS:

**BEST TIMES TO REACH OUT:**
- Weekday afternoons (2-4 PM) - between lunch and dinner rush
- Avoid Friday-Sunday (high-volume service periods)
- Early December or January (post-holiday, planning mode)

**URGENCY FACTORS:**
- No immediate crisis detected (not desperate)
- Chronic pain = ongoing receptivity
- Q1 2026 planning season approaching = good timing for new solutions

- 7shifts (popular in full-service restaurants)
- HotSchedules/Fourth (enterprise-focused, may be corporate preference)
- When I Work
- Homebase
- Deputy

**DIFFERENTIATION OPPORTUNITIES:**
- Focus on employee retention features (major pain point here)
- Emphasize ease of implementation for high-turnover environment
- Mobile accessibility for younger workforce
- Integration capabilities with existing Pappas systems
