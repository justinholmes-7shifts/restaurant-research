# Estimating Restaurant Employee Count (5 vs 15+ Employees)

**Why This Matters:**
- Pricing tiers (many software companies charge differently for 5-15, 15-50, 50+ employees)
- Qualification thresholds (some only sell to 15+ employee locations)
- Understanding operational complexity
- Sales approach (small team vs medium operation)

---

## Quick Reference Guide

### 5 Employees or Less (Micro)
- Counter service only (no table service)
- Owner + 4 part-timers typical
- Limited hours (6-8 hours/day, 5-6 days/week)
- One shift operation
- Examples: Small sandwich shop, coffee kiosk, food truck

### 6-15 Employees (Small)
- Table service OR high-volume counter service
- 2 shifts (lunch + dinner) with minimal overlap
- Open 10-12 hours/day, 6-7 days/week
- 1-2 managers + hourly staff
- Examples: Small diner, casual restaurant, QSR franchise

### 16-30 Employees (Medium)
- Full-service restaurant
- 2-3 shifts with overlap
- Open 12-16 hours/day, 7 days/week
- Multiple managers
- Examples: Mid-size casual dining, sports bar, large QSR

### 31+ Employees (Large)
- High-volume operation
- Multiple shifts, full week coverage
- Multiple managers + supervisors
- Examples: Golden Corral buffet, Chuy's, high-volume chains

---

## Method 1: Square Footage + Service Model (Most Reliable)

**Formula:** Square footage ÷ seats × service model multiplier

### Step 1: Find Square Footage
- Google: "[Restaurant name] square feet" or "sq ft"
- Commercial real estate listings
- Building permits (city records)
- Typical ranges:
  - Small: 1,000-2,000 sq ft
  - Medium: 2,000-4,000 sq ft
  - Large: 4,000-8,000 sq ft
  - Very Large: 8,000+ sq ft

### Step 2: Estimate Seating
- Count from photos (Google Maps, Yelp photos)
- Square footage ÷ 15 = rough seat count (full service)
- Square footage ÷ 20 = rough seat count (counter service)

### Step 3: Apply Service Model Multiplier

| Service Model | Employees per Seat | Notes |
|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| Counter service only | 0.10-0.15 | 1 employee per 7-10 customers |
| Fast casual | 0.15-0.25 | 1 employee per 4-7 customers |
| Casual dining | 0.25-0.35 | 1 employee per 3-4 customers |
| Fine dining | 0.35-0.50 | 1 employee per 2-3 customers |
| Buffet | 0.20-0.30 | Lower server ratio, higher kitchen |

**Example Calculation:**

**Flower Child (from our data):**
- Estimated: 2,500 sq ft (typical fast casual)
- Seating: ~100-125 seats
- Service model: Fast casual (0.20 multiplier)
- **Estimated employees: 100 × 0.20 = 20-25 employees**
- **Threshold: 15+ ✓**

**Small coffee shop:**
- 800 sq ft
- Seating: ~20 seats
- Service model: Counter service (0.12 multiplier)
- **Estimated employees: 20 × 0.12 = 2-3 + owner = 4-5 total**
- **Threshold: Under 5**

---

## Method 2: Operating Hours × Shift Coverage

**Formula:** (Hours open per week ÷ 40) × 2 = minimum employees

### Why × 2?
- Employees work 20-30 hours average (not 40)
- Need coverage for days off, sick time, turnover
- Multiple positions (FOH, BOH, management)

**Examples:**

**Restaurant A:**
- Open 7 days × 12 hours = 84 hours/week
- 84 ÷ 40 = 2.1 full-time equivalents
- 2.1 × 2 = **~4-5 employees minimum**
- **Threshold: Under 15**

**Restaurant B:**
- Open 7 days × 16 hours = 112 hours/week
- 112 ÷ 40 = 2.8 FTE
- 2.8 × 2 = **~6 employees minimum**
- Reality with multiple shifts: **10-15 employees**
- **Threshold: Right at 15**

**Restaurant C (24/7 diner):**
- Open 7 days × 24 hours = 168 hours/week
- 168 ÷ 40 = 4.2 FTE
- 4.2 × 2 = **~8-9 minimum**
- Reality with 3 shifts: **15-20 employees**
- **Threshold: 15+ ✓**

---

## Method 3: Job Posting Clues

### Look for these phrases in job postings:

**Under 5 employees:**
- "Small team"
- "Family-owned and operated"
- "Owner on-site daily"
- "Wear multiple hats"
- No management positions posted

**6-15 employees:**
- "Growing team"
- "Join our crew"
- Hiring for: Server, Cook, Dishwasher (basic positions)
- 1 manager mentioned

**16+ employees:**
- "Join our team of 20+"
- "Multiple shift options available"
- Hiring: Shift leads, Assistant Managers, Kitchen Manager
- "We're hiring for all positions"
- "Day shift, night shift, weekend shift"

**Example from our data:**

**Pappadeaux:**
- Job posting mentions: "Servers, Hosts, Bussers, Cooks, Service Assistants, To-Go Specialists"
- 7+ different positions hiring simultaneously
- **Estimate: 30-50+ employees per location**

---

## Method 4: LinkedIn Company Page

**How to check:**
1. Search "[Restaurant name] [City]" on LinkedIn
2. Click "See all employees"
3. Filter by location (if chain)

**Limitations:**
- Many hourly workers don't have LinkedIn
- Only shows ~20-40% of actual headcount
- Multiply LinkedIn count × 3-5 for real estimate

**Rule of thumb:**
- 1-2 employees on LinkedIn = 5-10 actual
- 3-5 employees on LinkedIn = 10-20 actual
- 6-10 employees on LinkedIn = 20-40 actual
- 11+ employees on LinkedIn = 40+ actual

---

## Method 5: Employee Reviews Mentioning Team Size

Search Indeed/Glassdoor reviews for:
- "team of [X]"
- "staff of [X]"
- "we had [X] people on shift"
- "crew size"

**Example quotes:**

*"I worked with a team of 8-10 people per shift"*
- 2 shifts = 16-20 employees
- **Threshold: 15+ ✓**

*"It was just me, the owner, and 2 other people"*
- Total: 4 employees
- **Threshold: Under 5**

*"On busy nights we'd have 3 servers, 2 cooks, 1 host, 1 busser, and a manager = 8 people"*
- Busy shift = 8
- Likely 2-3 shifts = 15-20 total
- **Threshold: 15+ ✓**

---

## Method 6: Google Reviews Volume Pattern

**Theory:** More reviews = more customers = more staff needed

| Monthly Reviews | Estimated Traffic | Estimated Staff |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 0-5 reviews/month | Low volume | 3-8 employees |
| 6-15 reviews/month | Medium volume | 8-15 employees |
| 16-30 reviews/month | High volume | 15-25 employees |
| 31+ reviews/month | Very high volume | 25+ employees |

**Calculation:**
- Total reviews ÷ years in business ÷ 12 = monthly review rate

**Example from our data:**

**Pappadeaux (Dallas):**
- 6,511 reviews
- In business ~20 years (estimate)
- 6,511 ÷ 20 ÷ 12 = ~27 reviews/month
- **Estimate: 25-40+ employees ✓**

**Malai Kitchen:**
- 2,295 reviews
- In business ~8 years
- 2,295 ÷ 8 ÷ 12 = ~24 reviews/month
- **Estimate: 20-30 employees ✓**

---

## Method 7: Check Health Inspection Reports

Some city health departments list employee count on inspection reports.

**How to access:**
1. Google: "[City] health inspection records"
2. Search restaurant name
3. Look for fields like:
   - "Number of employees"
   - "Staff count"
   - "Food handlers"

**Example cities with public data:**
- Dallas County: https://www.dallascounty.org/departments/dchhs/
- Miami-Dade: https://www.miamidade.gov/global/service.page?Mduid_service=ser1492371977362244
- Philadelphia: https://www.phila.gov/programs/food-safety/

**Limitation:** Not all jurisdictions publish this data

---

## Method 8: Yelp/Google Maps Photos Analysis

**Count visible staff in photos:**
- Look for "staff photo" or "team photo" tags
- Behind-the-scenes kitchen photos
- Group shots

**Clues:**
- Photo shows 8-10 people = likely 15-25 total (not everyone in one photo)
- Kitchen photos show 4-5 people working = 8-15 total staff
- Front-of-house with 5 servers visible = probably 10-20 total

---

## Method 9: Job Posting Count × Position Multiplier

**Active job openings can indicate total team size:**

| Open Positions | Likely Total Staff | Logic |
|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| 1-2 positions | 5-15 employees | 10-20% turnover |
| 3-5 positions | 15-30 employees | High turnover or growth |
| 6-10 positions | 30-60 employees | Crisis or major expansion |
| 11+ positions | 60+ employees | Large operation |

**Rule of thumb:** Open positions = 10-30% of total headcount

**Example from our data:**

**Chuy's (1 location):**
- 1,035 openings ÷ ~100 locations = ~10 openings per location
- 10 openings suggests: 30-50 employees per location
- **Threshold: 15+ ✓**

**Malai Kitchen:**
- "Open interviews Mon-Fri at ALL 4 locations"
- Not specific count, but continuous hiring suggests: 15-25 per location
- **Threshold: 15+ likely**

## Adding Employee Count to Lead Qualification

**Recommendation:** Add an "Estimated Employee Count" field to research tracking.

**Priority tiers:**
- **Tier 1 (31+ employees):** Enterprise pricing, higher contract value
- **Tier 2 (16-30 employees):** Standard pricing, good fit
- **Tier 3 (6-15 employees):** Small business pricing
- **Tier 4 (<5 employees):** May not qualify or need lite version

**For our current qualified leads:**
- 7 out of 8 qualify for 15+ tier ✓
- 1 borderline (Schlotzsky's - need to verify)

---

## Automation Opportunity

**Add to research script:**

```python
def estimate_employee_count(restaurant):
    """
    Estimate employee count based on available data.
    Returns tuple: (low_estimate, high_estimate, confidence)
    """

    # Method 1: Reviews per month
    if restaurant['reviews'] and restaurant['years_in_business']:
        monthly_reviews = restaurant['reviews'] / restaurant['years_in_business'] / 12
        if monthly_reviews > 30:
            return (25, 40, 'medium')
        elif monthly_reviews > 15:
            return (15, 25, 'medium')
        elif monthly_reviews > 5:
            return (8, 15, 'low')
        else:
            return (3, 8, 'low')

    # Method 2: Job posting count
    if restaurant['open_positions'] >= 6:
        return (30, 60, 'medium')
    elif restaurant['open_positions'] >= 3:
        return (15, 30, 'medium')

    # Method 3: Restaurant type heuristics
    if 'buffet' in restaurant['name'].lower():
        return (40, 70, 'low')
    elif 'fine dining' in restaurant['description'].lower():
        return (30, 50, 'low')

    # Default
    return (10, 20, 'very low')
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **5 vs 15 is a critical threshold** - Changes pricing, approach, features needed

2. **Multiple methods > single method** - Cross-validate with 2-3 approaches

3. **Service model matters most:**
   - Counter service: Lower staff ratios
   - Full service: Higher staff ratios
   - Buffet: Medium staff, high headcount due to volume

4. **Operating hours are the easiest signal:**
   - 12+ hours/day, 7 days = almost always 15+
   - Under 8 hours/day = rarely more than 15

5. **Our qualified leads are all 15+ tier** (except maybe 1)
   - Good news: Higher contract values
   - All have complex scheduling needs

6. **For borderline cases:** Just ask in discovery
   - "How many people do you typically have on staff?"
   - "How many employees on a busy shift?"

## Recommended Research Addition

**Add to `research_priority_list.csv`:**
- New column: `estimated_employees`
- Values: "<5", "6-15", "16-30", "31+"
- New column: `employee_estimation_method`
- Values: "square_footage", "hours_based", "reviews", "job_postings", "unknown"

**Add to manual research checklist:**
- [ ] Check operating hours (Google Maps)
- [ ] Estimate seating from photos
- [ ] Look for team size mentions in reviews
- [ ] Count visible staff in photos
- [ ] Calculate: employees = (hours/week ÷ 40) × 2

This becomes another qualification layer on top of staffing pain signals.
