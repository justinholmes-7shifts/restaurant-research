### 3. CUSTOMER REVIEWS - SERVICE QUALITY ANALYSIS

**Overall Assessment:** Customer reviews are PREDOMINANTLY POSITIVE regarding service, which is actually notable. This suggests the team is working hard to maintain service despite understaffing - a common pattern in restaurants struggling with labor but prioritizing customer experience.

**A. Recent Positive Service Reviews (2024-2025)**

**Preston Center Location:**
- "Always great meal, service excellent!!" - 10/10 (February 2025, TableAgent)
- "Great food, service, atmosphere!" - 10/10 (December 2024, TableAgent)
- "The best Thai food we have had in Dallas. Exceptional customer service." (October 2024)
- "Fabulous spot to enjoy great food, in a nice relaxed atmosphere, with great service"
- "Easy parking and very well trained, hospitable staff"
- Source: https://tableagent.com/dallas/malai-kitchen-lptyfpec/

**Uptown Location:**
- "Fantastic and quick service"
- "EXCELLENT STAFF SERVICE from when you walk in the door"
- "Service was pleasant and efficient"
- "Servers were very attentive and helpful"
- Source: https://www.yelp.com/biz/malai-kitchen-dallas

**B. Isolated Service Complaints**

**Quote:**
> "Our server forgot we ordered the rolls"
- Context: Isolated incident, not pattern of understaffing
- Source: Customer review

**Quote:**
> "Incredibly rude staff"
- Context: Restaurant management responded to complaint
- Assessment: Individual service failure, not systemic understaffing issue

**C. Analysis:**

The absence of widespread customer complaints about slow service, long waits, or being understaffed is significant. However, this doesn't contradict the employee evidence - it suggests:

1. Management is maintaining service standards despite staffing strain (by overworking existing staff - hence the 50-60 hour weeks)
2. The pain is being felt internally (employee burnout, difficulty taking time off) rather than externally
3. This is unsustainable and makes them a GOOD candidate for workforce optimization tools

**Social Media Hiring Posts:**
- No Facebook or Instagram specific hiring posts found in search
- Hiring appears to be primarily through career page and job boards
- Assessment: Not using social media for urgent recruitment (suggests they may not be maximizing recruitment channels)

### KEY TALKING POINTS (Customized to Malai Kitchen)

**1. OPENING HOOK (Choose One):**

**Option A - Peer Reference:**
> "Mike, I noticed Malai Kitchen is already using 7shifts for your job postings. I wanted to reach out because many growing Thai and Vietnamese concepts like yours are finding that the same platform can solve the scheduling challenges that come with running multiple high-volume locations."

**Option B - Understaffing Pain:**
> "Mike, I work with multi-location restaurant groups in Dallas who are struggling to reduce overtime and make it easier for staff to actually take time off. Given that Malai Kitchen operates four busy locations, I thought this might resonate with some of the challenges you're facing."

**Option C - Multi-Location Complexity:**
> "Mike, I help restaurant groups like Malai Kitchen that operate multiple locations in the Dallas area. With your Uptown, Preston Center, Southlake, and Fort Worth sites, you're juggling scheduling across four different teams - I'd love to show you how we help operators simplify that."

**2. CORE PAIN POINTS TO REFERENCE:**

**Staffing & Overtime:**
- "Many of our clients were dealing with team members working 50-60+ hour weeks because they couldn't efficiently schedule across their locations. Does that sound familiar?"
- "One thing we help with is making it easier for staff to actually get time off approved without leaving you short-handed."

**Multi-Location Scheduling:**
- "With four locations and 185+ team members, coordinating schedules manually must be incredibly time-consuming. We help managers build schedules in a fraction of the time."
- "We also help restaurant groups like yours see labor costs in real-time across all locations from one dashboard."

**Manager Communication:**
- "A common challenge with multiple locations is making sure all your managers are on the same page with schedule changes. Our platform sends automatic notifications so everyone stays in sync."

**Hiring & Turnover:**
- "I saw you're running open interviews Monday through Friday at all four locations. We can help streamline that hiring process and track candidates across your different sites."

**3. VALUE PROPOSITION SPECIFIC TO MALAI KITCHEN:**

**Time Savings:**
- "Most of our multi-location clients cut their scheduling time by 50-75%. For four locations, that could mean 10-15 hours back per week for your managers."

**Labor Cost Reduction:**
- "We help restaurants reduce overtime by 20-30% on average by optimizing schedules and making it easier to move staff between locations when needed."

**Retention & Work-Life Balance:**
- "With the industry labor shortage, keeping your team happy is critical. We help improve work-life balance by giving employees more control over their schedules through shift-swapping and availability preferences."

**Growth Enablement:**
- "As you continue growing - whether it's new Malai Kitchen locations or concepts like Brya Zan - you'll need systems that scale. We make it easy to replicate your scheduling process across new sites."

**4. RISK MITIGATION:**

**Address the "We're Already Using Something" Objection:**
> "I noticed you're already using 7shifts for job postings. Are you using the full scheduling and time tracking features, or primarily the hiring module? Many restaurants start with one piece and then expand once they see the ROI."

**Alternative if using competitors:**
> "I know many restaurants are using [When I Work/HotSchedules/etc.]. What we're finding is that as you grow to 4+ locations, the need for more sophisticated labor analytics and cross-location visibility becomes critical. Happy to show you a comparison."

### OUTREACH SEQUENCE

**Email Sequence:**

**Email #1 - Initial Outreach (Week 1)**
Subject: Multi-location scheduling for Malai Kitchen's 4 DFW sites

Hi Mike,

I help multi-location restaurant groups in the Dallas area optimize their scheduling and reduce labor costs across all their sites.

With Malai Kitchen operating four locations (Uptown, Preston Center, Southlake, and Fort Worth), I imagine coordinating schedules and managing 185+ employees across those sites takes up a significant amount of your management team's time.

I'd love to show you how restaurants similar to yours are:
- Cutting scheduling time by 50%+ across multiple locations
- Reducing overtime by 20-30% with better schedule optimization
- Making it easier for staff to get time off without leaving you short-handed

Would you be open to a 15-minute call next week? I can share some specific examples from other Thai/Vietnamese concepts in Texas.

Best,
[Your Name]

---

**Email #2 - Follow-up (Week 2, if no response)**
Subject: Re: Multi-location scheduling for Malai Kitchen

Mike,

Following up on my note below. I noticed Malai Kitchen is hiring across all four locations right now - when you're in growth mode, having the right scheduling tools becomes even more critical.

Quick question: Are you currently using any workforce management software for scheduling, or is this still being done manually/with spreadsheets?

Either way, I'd love to share how we help restaurants like yours:
1. Schedule 4+ locations from one dashboard
2. See real-time labor costs across all sites
3. Fill open shifts faster with employee shift-swapping

Let me know if a brief call makes sense.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

---

**Email #3 - Value-Add Content (Week 3, if no response)**
Subject: Reducing overtime in multi-location restaurants (case study)

Mike,

I wanted to share a quick case study that might be relevant to Malai Kitchen.

We recently worked with a 5-location Vietnamese restaurant group in Houston that was dealing with:
- Managers working 60+ hours/week just on scheduling
- High overtime costs because they couldn't efficiently move staff between locations
- Staff turnover due to schedule unpredictability

Within 90 days of implementing our workforce management platform, they:
- Cut scheduling time from 15 hours/week to 3 hours/week
- Reduced overtime costs by $8,400/month
- Improved employee retention by 23%

Given your four locations and growth plans with Brya Zan, I think there could be similar opportunities for Malai Kitchen.

Would you be open to a brief conversation to explore this?

Best,
[Your Name]

---

**Phone Script (If Calling):**

**Opening:**
"Hi Mike, this is [Name] from [Company]. I help multi-location restaurant groups in the Dallas area with workforce management. I was researching Malai Kitchen and saw you're operating four locations across DFW - is now a good time for a quick chat, or should I call back?"

**If Yes:**
"Great! I'll keep this brief. I noticed you have locations in Uptown, Preston Center, Southlake, and Fort Worth - with that many sites, how are you currently handling scheduling? Is it done at each location individually, or do you have a centralized system?"

**Discovery Questions:**
1. "With 185+ employees across four locations, what's the biggest challenge you face with scheduling?"
2. "How much time would you estimate your managers spend per week building schedules?"
3. "Do you have visibility into labor costs in real-time, or do you find out after the fact?"
4. "When you need to fill an open shift, what's your current process?"
5. "Are you seeing any overtime issues or challenges with staff getting time off?"

**Transition to Meeting:**
"Based on what you're sharing, I think there could be some significant opportunities to save time and reduce labor costs. Would it make sense to schedule a 30-minute demo where I can show you specifically how we'd address [pain point mentioned]?"

---

### TIMING CONSIDERATIONS

**BEST TIME TO REACH OUT: NOW**

**Favorable Timing Factors:**
1. **Active hiring mode** - "ASAP" host position suggests immediate need
2. **End of year** - Budget planning season, more open to new solutions for 2026
3. **Post-expansion phase** - Preston Center opened 2021, likely feeling operational strain now
4. **New concept launch** - Brya Zan spinoff creates added complexity

**Approach Timing:**
- Best days: Tuesday-Thursday
- Best times: 2:00-4:00 PM (between lunch rush and dinner prep)
- Avoid: Friday evenings, weekends (peak service times)

---

## RESEARCH LIMITATIONS & CONFIDENCE NOTES

### HIGH CONFIDENCE DATA:
- Employee reviews clearly stating understaffing ("always understaffed", "hard to take time off")
- Multi-location structure (4 locations confirmed)
- Active hiring across all locations
- Company size (185+ employees)
- Contact information for GM Mike Arcilla
- 7shifts platform usage (job postings)

### MEDIUM CONFIDENCE DATA:
- Work-life balance rating (2.7/5) - based on 25 Glassdoor reviews (small sample)
- Specific manager scheduling manipulation - single employee mention
- Overtime amounts (50-60 hours) - anecdotal employee reports

### LOW CONFIDENCE / GAPS:
- **Current software stack** - Unknown if using full scheduling software or just hiring tools
- **Budget/buying authority** - Don't know if Mike Arcilla has final decision power vs. owners
- **Recent customer complaints** - Limited 2024-2025 customer review access (Yelp blocked)
- **Social media hiring urgency** - Could not access Facebook/Instagram directly
- **Specific Preston Center location pain** - Most evidence is company-wide, not location-specific
- **Recent turnover data** - No hard numbers on retention rates

### RECOMMENDED ADDITIONAL VERIFICATION:

**Before First Call:**
1. Check if Malai Kitchen has public financial data (revenue estimates help with pricing)
2. Visit Preston Center location in person during peak hours to observe staffing levels
3. Attempt to access their Facebook page directly to see if there are recent hiring posts
4. Search for any recent Dallas Business Journal or CultureMap articles about expansion plans

**During Discovery Call:**
5. Ask about current scheduling tools/software in use
6. Confirm Mike's role in purchasing decisions (or get introduced to owners)
7. Understand if all locations have same pain points or if one is worse
8. Get actual labor cost % and overtime data if willing to share

## COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE

### LIKELY CURRENT STATE:
Based on 7shifts job posting presence, they may be using:
- **7shifts** (confirmed for applicant tracking, unknown if full platform)
- **Manual scheduling** (spreadsheets/paper)
- **POS system scheduling** (Toast, Square, Clover)

### POTENTIAL OBJECTIONS TO ANTICIPATE:

**"We're already using 7shifts"**
Response: "That's great - are you using the full scheduling and labor management features, or primarily for hiring? Many of our clients started with just applicant tracking and found huge value in adding the scheduling piece."

**"We're too busy to implement new software"**
Response: "I totally understand - that's why we've built our onboarding to take less than 2 weeks, and we do most of the heavy lifting. One of our clients just opened their 4th location and said implementing our system actually saved them time because their new location was up and running in days instead of weeks."

**"It's too expensive"**
Response: "I appreciate the concern about cost. Let me ask - if you could reduce your overtime spend by even 10%, what would that mean in dollar terms? Most of our multi-location clients find the software pays for itself in the first 60 days just through labor cost savings."

**"Our managers like their current process"**
Response: "Change is definitely hard. What we find is that once managers see they can build a schedule in 20 minutes instead of 3 hours, they become our biggest advocates. Would it help if I connected you with a reference from another multi-location restaurant group in Texas?"
