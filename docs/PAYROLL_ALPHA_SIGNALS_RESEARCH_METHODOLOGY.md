# Payroll Alpha Signals Research Methodology

**Purpose:** Identify restaurants experiencing acute payroll pain where timing is right for them to buy payroll software.

**Time per restaurant:** 10-15 minutes

**Key Principle:** Look for EVIDENCE of payroll pain, not assumptions. Restaurants with high volume don't necessarily have payroll problems. We need concrete signals.

## Research Checklist (Complete in Order)

### Step 1: Legal & Compliance Check (3-4 minutes)

**DOL Investigation Search:**
```
Search: "[Restaurant Name] Department of Labor"
Search: "[Restaurant Name] wage theft"
Search: "[Restaurant Name] FLSA violation"
Search: "[Restaurant Name] overtime lawsuit"
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ DOL news releases with restaurant name
- ✅ Wage and hour settlements or judgments
- ✅ Class action lawsuits for unpaid wages/tips
- ✅ State labor department violations

**Where to search:**
1. DOL.gov regional news (search by state)
2. Google News with date filter (last 2 years)
3. Local news sites + business journals
4. Court record sites (if easily accessible)

**Document:**
- Date of incident/settlement
- Amount of settlement (indicates severity)
- Type of violation (overtime, tips, off-clock work)
- Quote any official statements

---

### Step 2: Employee Review Deep Dive (4-5 minutes)

**Priority platforms:**
1. Indeed (most employee reviews for restaurants)
2. Glassdoor
3. Reddit (search: "reddit [restaurant name] employee")

**Search within reviews for these EXACT phrases:**

**Tier 1 - Critical Pain (10 pts each):**
- "not paid for"
- "clock out and keep working"
- "forced to work off the clock"
- "tip theft"
- "tips stolen"
- "paycheck is wrong"
- "never paid on time"
- "hours missing from my check"

**Tier 2 - Strong Pain (7 pts each):**
- "no overtime pay"
- "60+ hours" (without "salaried" context)
- "70+ hours" (even if salaried - misclassification risk)
- "split hours across locations" (OT avoidance)
- "tip pool is wrong"
- "tip out calculations are always wrong"
- "fight to get paid correctly"

**Tier 3 - Moderate Pain (4 pts each):**
- "always understaffed" (drives overtime costs)
- "working doubles constantly" (overtime)
- "no breaks" (labor law violation)
- "manual time cards" / "paper timesheets"
- "handwritten schedules"

**How to search efficiently:**
- Indeed: Filter to 1-2 star reviews first
- Use browser find (Cmd/Ctrl+F) for keywords
- Read at least 10-15 recent reviews
- Look for patterns (multiple employees saying same thing)

**Document:**
- Copy exact quotes with quotation marks
- Note date of review (within 6 months = current)
- Count how many employees mention same issue
- Note reviewer's role (server, manager, cook)

---

### Step 3: Customer Review Payroll Signals (2 minutes)

**Platforms:**
- Yelp (sort by recent, 1-2 stars)
- Google Reviews (recent)

**What to look for:**
- Staff complaining to customers about pay
- Service issues due to understaffing (drives OT)
- Mentions of "cash only" (tip reporting issues)
- "Just went cashless" (tip complexity increase)

**Search for:**
```
"server told us" + pay/tips/wages
"bartender mentioned" + pay/tips
"staff said they" + pay/tips
"understaffed" (drives overtime)
```

**Document:**
- Quote customer mentioning staff pay complaints
- Note service issues that suggest understaffing
- Any mentions of payment/tip policy changes

---

### Step 4: Operational Complexity Indicators (2-3 minutes)

**Multi-Location Analysis:**
- Count total locations (company website)
- Note if locations cross state lines
- Identify if they cross time zones
- Check if states have different tip credit laws

**Tip Credit Research:**
- Quick reference:
  - **Tip credit allowed:** TX, FL, PA, GA, OH, NC, TN, etc.
  - **No tip credit:** CA, WA, OR, NV, MN, MT, AK
  - **Partial:** NY, MA, CO, AZ, etc.
- If multi-state: note complexity level

**Recent Changes:**
- Search: "[Restaurant Name] new location 2024"
- Search: "[Restaurant Name] acquired 2024"
- Search: "[Restaurant Name] new ownership"
- Check LinkedIn for recent GM/Director of Ops hires

**Look for:**
- ✅ Expansion across state lines (payroll complexity)
- ✅ Acquisition announcements (system integration)
- ✅ New leadership (opportunity to pitch solutions)
- ✅ POS system changes (integration window)

**Document:**
- Total locations + states
- Recent expansion plans
- Ownership/leadership changes
- Technology changes mentioned

---

### Step 5: Job Posting Analysis (1-2 minutes)

**Platforms:**
- Indeed
- Company careers page
- LinkedIn Jobs

**Look for:**
- "Weekly pay" mentions (processing burden)
- "Daily pay" / "DailyPay" mentions (3rd party band-aid)
- "Competitive wages" with specific amounts (margin pressure)
- Multiple manager positions open (turnover = payroll chaos)
- "Immediate hire" language (desperation)

**Red flags for payroll pain:**
- Offering daily/weekly pay = employees demanding faster pay
- Multiple locations all hiring = scaling payroll complexity
- Manager turnover = no consistency in time tracking

**Document:**
- Pay frequency mentioned
- Number of open positions
- Urgency language
- Any payroll-related benefits mentioned

**Score 8-9:**
- 5+ employees reporting paycheck errors
- Tip theft mentioned by multiple employees
- Multi-state expansion in progress

**Score 6-7:**
- 2-4 employees reporting pay issues

- Complex tip pooling with error complaints
- Weekly pay switch announced
- Multi-state operations with tip credit differences

### Moderate Factors (Score 4-5):

**Score 4-5:**
- 1 employee reporting pay issues
- High overtime hours (but paid)
- Multi-location same state
- Recent POS change
- Chronic understaffing (drives OT costs)

### Low/No Pain (Score 0-3):

**Score 0-3:**
- No payroll mentions in reviews
- Single location
- No legal issues

**TIER 2 - Strong Evidence (Pursue This Week):**

- Recent ownership/system changes
- Weekly pay switch + high volume

**TIER 3 - Moderate Evidence (Qualify Further):**
- 1 employee mention
- High OT hours but possibly paid
- Multi-location complexity

## Time Management Tips

**Set a timer for 15 minutes per restaurant.**

**Minute-by-minute breakdown:**
- Minutes 0-3: DOL/legal search
- Minutes 4-8: Employee reviews (Indeed, Glassdoor)
- Minutes 9-10: Customer reviews (Yelp, Google)
- Minutes 11-13: Operational complexity research
- Minutes 14-15: Job postings + documentation

**If you find a "smoking gun" (DOL violation, multiple wage theft mentions):**
- Stop other research
- Deep dive on that signal
- Document thoroughly
- Mark as Tier 1 Evidence

**If you find nothing after 10 minutes:**
- Quick check of remaining sources
- Mark as "No Evidence"
- Move to next restaurant

- Legal evidence (DOL, lawsuits)
- Operational complexity indicators
- Recent changes creating payroll challenges

❌ **Don't count as evidence:**
- Generic "bad management" reviews
- Scheduling complaints (different pain)
- Food quality issues
- Single vague mention

✅ **Do count as evidence:**
- Specific payroll error descriptions
- Multiple employees saying same thing
- Legal/compliance documentation
- Public acknowledgment of pay issues

## Next Steps After Research

1. **Score each restaurant** using the payroll pain scoring system

3. **Prioritize by:**
   - Evidence tier (1 > 2 > 3)
   - Pain score (10 > 9 > 8, etc.)
   - Contact quality (decision maker email > phone > LinkedIn)
4. **Create outreach strategy** based on specific pain points found
