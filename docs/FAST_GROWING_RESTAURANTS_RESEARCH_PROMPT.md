### Phase 4: Score & Prioritize

Score each restaurant on **Growth-Driven Workforce Pain Potential** (0-100):

#### Scoring Rubric:

**Growth Velocity (0-40 points):**
- 30-40: Opened 10+ locations in past 12 months OR 50%+ YoY growth
- 20-29: Opened 5-9 locations in past 12 months OR 25-49% YoY growth
- 10-19: Opened 3-4 locations in past 12 months OR 15-24% YoY growth
- 0-9: Slower growth

**Workforce Pain Evidence (0-30 points):**
- 25-30: Strong evidence (job postings + employee reviews + customer complaints)
- 15-24: Moderate evidence (2 of 3 signals present)
- 5-14: Some evidence (1 signal present)
- 0-4: No clear evidence

**Contact Quality (0-20 points):**
- 20: VP+ level with verified email + phone + LinkedIn
- 15: Director level with verified email + LinkedIn
- 10: Manager level with email or LinkedIn
- 5: Generic company contact only
- 0: No contact found

**Market Opportunity (0-10 points):**
- 10: Actively franchising + multi-state + funded + 30-75 locations
- 7-9: Strong growth trajectory + 20-50 locations
- 4-6: Regional expansion + 10-30 locations
- 0-3: Early stage or limited expansion

**Priority Tiers:**
- **Tier 1 (80-100 points):** Immediate outreach - high growth + clear pain + good contacts
- **Tier 2 (60-79 points):** Strong candidates - research further before outreach
- **Tier 3 (40-59 points):** Watch list - monitor for stronger signals
- **Tier 4 (<40 points):** Deprioritize - insufficient signals

## Research Targets

**Goal:** Find 50-100 fast-growing restaurant chains under 100 locations

**Expected Breakdown:**
- Tier 1 (Immediate Outreach): 10-15 restaurants
- Tier 2 (Strong Candidates): 20-30 restaurants
- Tier 3 (Watch List): 20-30 restaurants
- Tier 4 (Deprioritize): Remainder

## Research Tips

1. **Start with Known Fast-Growers:**
   - Check Nation's Restaurant News "Top 200 Growth Chains" and filter for under 100 units
   - Review Franchise Times "Fast & Serious" list
   - Look at recent Restaurant Business "Future 50" lists

2. **Regional to National Expansion:**
   - Restaurant chains expanding from one region (e.g., Southeast) to national presence
   - These often experience the most acute growing pains

3. **Ghost Kitchen Brands:**
   - Virtual brands expanding rapidly through existing kitchen infrastructure
   - Often have complex workforce management needs

4. **Recent Franchise Launches:**
   - Brands that just started franchising in past 2-3 years
   - Often lack mature workforce systems

5. **Post-Funding Expansion:**
   - Companies that raised Series A/B in 2023-2024 and are deploying capital for growth
   - Growth often outpaces operational maturity

6. **Red Flags to Avoid:**
   - Restaurants in bankruptcy or financial distress
   - Brands with severe reputation damage
   - Concepts with declining same-store sales despite opening new locations
   - Franchises with high franchisee turnover/litigation

## Success Criteria

**High-Quality Lead** = Restaurant that meets ALL of these:
1. Under 100 locations currently
2. Opened 5+ new locations in past 12 months OR has funded expansion plan
3. At least 2 workforce pain signals identified
4. VP or Director level contact with verified email
5. Growth trajectory suggests they'll reach 75-150 locations within 18-24 months

**Why This Matters:**
Restaurants in rapid growth (especially 30-75 location range expanding to 100+) are in the "scale-up pain zone" - large enough to need enterprise solutions, growing fast enough that manual processes are breaking, but haven't yet invested in mature workforce management infrastructure.

## Timeline & Effort Estimate

- **Research Time Per Restaurant:** 15-25 minutes
- **Target:** 50-100 qualified restaurants
- **Total Research Time:** 12-40 hours
- **Recommended Approach:** Research in batches of 10-15 restaurants at a time

## Next Steps After Research

Once you have 50-100 qualified leads:

1. **Tier 1 Restaurants (10-15):** Begin outreach within 1 week
2. **Tier 2 Restaurants (20-30):** Deepen research, schedule for outreach in weeks 2-4
3. **Tier 3 Restaurants (20-30):** Monitor quarterly for stronger signals
4. **Create Outreach Templates:** Customize messaging based on specific growth pain points discovered

---

**Remember:** The goal is NOT to find all restaurants under 100 locations. The goal is to find FAST-GROWING restaurants under 100 locations with EVIDENCE of workforce management pain. Quality over quantity.
