# Payroll Alpha Signals Scoring System

**Purpose:** Systematically score restaurants based on payroll pain evidence and contact quality to prioritize research and outreach.

## Two-Stage Scoring System

### Stage 1: Research Priority Score (0-100)
*Determines WHICH restaurants to research first*

### Stage 2: Payroll Pain Score (0-10)
*Determines HOW qualified they are after research*

## Automated Scoring (For Bulk Processing)

If processing 50+ restaurants, use this formula:

### Research Priority Score Formula:
```
Score = (Contact_Quality_Points) + (Operational_Complexity_Points) + (Preliminary_Pain_Points)

Max: 100 points
```

### Payroll Pain Score Formula:
```
Critical_Factors × 3.33 = Score (if ≥ 2 factors)
Strong_Factors × 2.0 = Score (if ≥ 2 factors)
Moderate_Factors × 1.5 = Score (if ≥ 2 factors)

Cap at 10
```

### Evidence Tier Auto-Classification:
```
IF (DOL_violation OR lawsuit OR 5+_employee_mentions):
    Tier = 1
ELIF (2-4_employee_mentions OR multi_state_complexity OR recent_changes):
    Tier = 2
ELIF (1_employee_mention OR operational_complexity):
    Tier = 3
ELSE:
    Tier = 4
```

## Scoring Calibration

To ensure consistency across researchers:

### Score 10 Benchmark:
"Chuy's Hypothetical" - Active DOL investigation + 8 employees reporting "forced to clock out and keep working" + customer reviews mentioning staff complained about stolen tips + $500K settlement announced last month

### Score 7 Benchmark:
"Taco Place" - 2 recent employee reviews mentioning paycheck errors + manual timesheet system mentioned + 12 locations across TX and FL (different tip credits) + recent POS change

### Score 4 Benchmark:
"Burger Joint" - 1 old review mentioning "management issues" + 6 locations in single state + chronic understaffing mentioned in reviews + no specific payroll mentions

### Score 1 Benchmark:
"Pizza Shop" - Single location + no payroll mentions + recent positive reviews about pay/management

## Next Steps After Scoring

1. **Sort by priority matrix** (Pain Score + Evidence Tier + Research Priority)
2. **Create outreach list** (Pain Score 6+ only)
3. **Draft personalized outreach** based on specific pain points found
4. **Track conversion rates** by score/tier to refine system

---

**Remember:** The score is a guide, not a rule. Use judgment. A Score 6 with Tier 1 evidence (DOL violation) may be better than a Score 7 with Tier 3 evidence (assumptions).
