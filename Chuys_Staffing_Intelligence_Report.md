## OUTREACH INTELLIGENCE

### PRIMARY CONTACT
**Name:** Willie Owens
**Title:** General Manager
**Email:** wowens@chuys.com
**Note:** Need to identify which specific Chuy's location Willie manages for tailored approach

### DECISION-MAKER RESEARCH GAPS
- Specific location for Willie Owens not identified in research
- May need to identify corporate contacts for enterprise-level decision
- Corporate HQ: Austin, TX (publicly traded company)
- May have centralized operations/technology decision-making

### BEST APPROACH

**1. Initial Contact Method:**
- Email to wowens@chuys.com with subject line referencing specific location pain points
- Alternatively, LinkedIn connection if profile can be located

**2. Timing Considerations:**
- **URGENT:** Evidence suggests ongoing crisis (1,035 openings, customer complaints)
- Q4/Q1 planning season - good timing for new system implementation
- Labor cost pressure creates immediate ROI opportunity

**3. Discovery Questions to Ask:**
- "How many open positions are you currently trying to fill at your location?"
- "What system are you currently using to create schedules?"
- "How much time per week does scheduling take you?"
- "Have you had to close sections or reduce hours due to staffing?"
- "Are you experiencing challenges with early/late punches or overtime?"

**4. Pain Point Prioritization for Pitch:**

**Lead with:** "I noticed Chuy's has over 1,000 open positions right now. At your location, are scheduling and labor costs your biggest headaches?"

**Primary Pain Points to Reference:**
1. **Scheduling chaos** - "Many Chuy's managers mention scheduling is a constant battle with availability conflicts and over/under-staffing issues"
2. **Labor cost pressure** - "With Chuy's facing 3-5% labor inflation, our customers typically save 2-4% on labor costs through better scheduling"
3. **Time & attendance** - "I saw Chuy's is focused on eliminating early/late punches - our system has built-in controls for that"
4. **Turnover** - "Customer reviews at multiple Chuy's locations mention understaffing. Better schedules improve retention by 27% on average"

**5. Objection Anticipation:**

*"We already have a scheduling system"*
→ "What's working well? What isn't? Most managers we talk to say their current system creates more problems than it solves."

*"Corporate would need to approve"*
→ "No problem - are you open to piloting at your location to show ROI before rolling out? Many corporate decisions start with successful single-unit tests."

*"Too busy dealing with staffing to implement new software"*
→ "That's exactly when you need it most. Implementation takes 2 weeks and managers typically save 5-8 hours per week immediately."

## COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE

### Likely Current State:
Based on corporate focus on "labor scheduling improvements" and "new system to eliminate early/late punches," Chuy's is either:
1. Using outdated/legacy scheduling system
2. Still doing paper/Excel schedules
3. Recently implemented something that isn't working well
4. Using basic POS scheduling features (inadequate)

### Potential Competitors Already in Play:
- HotSchedules (common in large chains)
- Restaurant365 (if using their accounting)
- POS system scheduling module (Toast, Aloha, etc.)
- Legacy systems (TimeForge, Humanity, etc.)

### Competitive Differentiation Needed:
- Emphasize ease of use vs. complex legacy systems
- Mobile-first approach for Gen Z workforce
- Fast implementation vs. lengthy enterprise rollouts
- Specific restaurant expertise vs. general workforce tools
