## Research Agent Capability

This analysis was performed using automated lead scoring. For deeper research on specific restaurants (e.g., checking recent job postings, social media for staffing complaints, review analysis for understaffing indicators), the `restaurant-staffing-researcher` agent can be deployed on individual targets.

Example use cases:
- "Research if Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen is currently hiring"
- "Check if Velvet Taco has staffing challenges based on reviews"
- "Analyze Gloria's Latin Cuisine for workforce management pain points"
