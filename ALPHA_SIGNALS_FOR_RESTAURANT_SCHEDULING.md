# Alpha Signals for Restaurant Scheduling Software

**Inspired by:** [The Commoditization of Signals](https://www.thesignal.club/p/the-commoditization-of-signals)

## The Framework

**Key Question:** "What would you look for in 30 minutes to determine if timing is right for them to buy scheduling software?"

The article distinguishes:
- **Commoditized Signals:** Everyone has access (job changes, funding, website visits)
- **Alpha Signals:** Niche, timing-focused, hard for competitors to replicate

---

## COMMODITIZED SIGNALS (What Everyone Uses)

These are **obvious** and **saturated**:

❌ "Restaurant is hiring" (every restaurant is always hiring)
❌ "High review count" (doesn't predict scheduling pain)
❌ "Recently opened" (timing maybe, but no pain signal)
❌ "Multi-location chain" (doesn't mean they need YOUR solution)
❌ "Low rating" (could be food quality, not operations)
❌ "Founded in [year]" (irrelevant to scheduling)
❌ Job change alerts for restaurant managers (saturated)

**Problem:** Every scheduling software company targets these. No competitive advantage.

## ALPHA SIGNALS (What We Discovered)

These indicate **acute scheduling pain RIGHT NOW**:

### 🔥 Tier 1: Critical Timing Signals (Pursue Immediately)

**1. "Start This Week" Job Posting Language**
- Example: Flower Child - "Apply today and start THIS WEEK"
- Signal: Desperation hiring, can't wait for normal onboarding
- **Why Alpha:** Requires reading actual job posting copy, not just "has job postings"
- **Timing Window:** 2-4 weeks (before they fill positions or give up)

**2. Walk-In Interview Events**
- Example: Flower Child - Daily walk-in interviews 3-4:30 PM at all locations
- Signal: Bypassing normal recruitment = crisis mode
- **Why Alpha:** Most job scrapers don't capture interview format
- **Timing Window:** Immediate (actively desperate)

**3. Employee Review Phrases About Scheduling**
- Example: Chuy's - *"Scheduling was a constant battle - management would forget your availability"*
- Specific phrases:
  - "scheduling is a constant battle"
  - "hours cut without notice"
  - "impossible to have a set schedule"
  - "can't request time off even months in advance"
  - "scheduled 3 days, allowed to work 1-2"
- **Why Alpha:** Requires manual review reading, can't be automated at scale (yet)
- **Timing Window:** Evergreen (chronic pain)

**4. Multiple GM Turnovers in Short Period**
- Example: Pappadeaux - "3 general managers in 2 years at Dallas location"
- Signal: Management chaos, operational breakdown
- **Why Alpha:** Requires tracking personnel changes over time from reviews
- **Timing Window:** During transition (new GM looking to fix problems)

**5. Customer Reviews Where Staff Admits Staffing Issues**
- Example: Chuy's - Customer review: *"staff mentioned they were experiencing staffing issues"*
- Example: Gloria's - Manager told customers *"there are no waiters available"*
- Signal: Problem so bad it's visible to customers
- **Why Alpha:** Requires reading customer review content, not star ratings
- **Timing Window:** Immediate (public embarrassment = urgency)

### ⚡ Tier 2: Strong Timing Signals (Pursue This Week)

**6. Corporate/CEO Public Acknowledgment of Labor Issues**
- Example: Golden Corral CEO - *"most difficult time in terms of staffing in my 40-year career"* ⚠️ **FROM 2021 - STALE**
- Example: Chuy's corporate - Acknowledged need for "labor scheduling improvements" ⚠️ **FROM 2018 - STALE**
- Signal: Executive awareness + willingness to invest
- **Why Alpha:** Requires monitoring earnings calls, FSR articles, trade press
- **Timing Window:** 1-3 months (budget approval cycle)
- **⚠️ RECENCY WARNING:** CEO quotes decay FAST. Only use quotes from last 3-6 months. Check article publication date!

**7. Extreme Job Posting Volume Relative to Size**
- Example: Chuy's - 1,035 open positions (indicates crisis, not growth)
- Signal: Not "hiring 5 people" but "hiring 1,000+"
- **Why Alpha:** Requires calculating ratio: openings / total locations
- **Timing Window:** 2-8 weeks (before they burn out trying to fill)

**8. "Always" or "Chronically" Understaffed Language in Reviews**
- Example: Chuy's - *"Chronically short staffed"* / *"Mostly always short staffed"*
- Example: Malai Kitchen - *"Always under staffed"*
- Signal: Chronic, not temporary problem = willing to invest in solutions
- **Why Alpha:** Specific language pattern (not just "busy")
- **Timing Window:** Evergreen

**9. Expansion Announcements + Current Hiring Struggles**
- Example: Gloria's - Opening Plano location Q1 2025 + current scheduling chaos across 23 locations
- Signal: Can't scale current broken process
- **Why Alpha:** Combining two data sources (expansion news + hiring/review data)
- **Timing Window:** 3-6 months before opening (implementation lead time)

**10. Employee 50+ Hour Week Complaints**
- Example: Gloria's - *"If you are not strict about what you cannot work they will give you 50+"*
- Example: Malai Kitchen - *"50-60+ hour weeks"*
- Signal: Labor cost bleed + compliance risk + burnout
- **Why Alpha:** Specific hour complaints (not "long hours")
- **Timing Window:** Evergreen (financial pain accumulating)

### 📊 Tier 3: Moderate Signals (Qualify Further)

**11. Management Communication Breakdown Mentions**
- Example: Gloria's - *"Management team don't work together nor communicate with each other"*
- Example: Flower Child - *"Zero communication between managers"*
- Signal: Multi-location coordination problems
- **Why Alpha:** Indicates need for centralized system
- **Timing Window:** Evergreen

**12. Already Using Basic Scheduling Platform**
- Example: Malai Kitchen - Using 7shifts for job posting board
- Signal: Platform familiarity, know they need software, might be dissatisfied
- **Why Alpha:** Competitor intelligence from job board sourcing
- **Timing Window:** Annual contract renewal (need to discover when)

**13. Franchise Operator with Turnover Philosophy**
- Example: Schlotzsky's (Albert Enterprises) - Owner publicly stated *"Turnover creates inefficiencies that cost major dollars"*
- Signal: Sophisticated operator who thinks in ROI terms
- **Why Alpha:** Requires researching franchise ownership and owner quotes
- **Timing Window:** Anytime (they're educated buyers)

**14. Work-Life Balance Ratings < 3.0**
- Example: Malai Kitchen - 2.7/5 work-life balance on Glassdoor
- Signal: Scheduling rigidity, burnout
- **Why Alpha:** Requires checking specific rating category, not overall
- **Timing Window:** Evergreen

**15. "High Turnover" + Management Cause Attribution**
- Example: Gloria's - *"High turnover rate, probably because management is incredibly harsh"*
- Signal: They're aware it's management/operations, not just "industry problem"
- **Why Alpha:** Requires reading review content for causal attribution
- **Timing Window:** Evergreen

## ALPHA SIGNAL COMBINATIONS (Even Stronger)

The most powerful signals come from **combining** multiple alpha signals:

### Combination 1: "Crisis + Awareness"
- 50+ job openings + CEO public acknowledgment
- Example: Golden Corral (6 local openings + CEO quote + franchise group scale)
- **Trigger:** Immediate outreach, reference CEO quote

### Combination 2: "Expansion Under Strain"
- New location opening + current scheduling chaos
- Example: Gloria's (Plano 2025 + 23 locations with scheduling complaints)
- **Trigger:** "Can't scale broken process" angle

### Combination 3: "Employee + Customer Visibility"
- Employee reviews about scheduling + customers noticing understaffing
- Example: Chuy's (employee scheduling complaints + customer told directly)
- **Trigger:** "Problem affecting customer experience" angle

### Combination 4: "Platform Switcher"
- Using basic platform + employee complaints about scheduling
- Example: Malai Kitchen (using 7shifts + complaints about time off)
- **Trigger:** Competitive displacement, timing = contract renewal

### Combination 5: "Sophisticated Operator"
- Multi-unit franchise + owner/CEO quotes about efficiency/ROI
- Example: Schlotzsky's (32 units + owner turnover quote)
- **Trigger:** Speak ROI language, enterprise deal

## HOW TO OPERATIONALIZE ALPHA SIGNALS

### Level 1: Manual (What We Did)
- Read employee reviews on Indeed/Glassdoor for scheduling phrases
- Read customer reviews on Yelp/Google for staffing admissions
- Search job postings for "start this week", "walk-in interview"
- Google "[restaurant] CEO staffing" for public acknowledgments
- Track expansion news + hiring volume

**Time:** 10-15 minutes per restaurant
**Hit Rate:** 80% (8 out of 10 had evidence)
**Conversion:** 35-50%

### Level 2: Semi-Automated (Build This)

**Create web scrapers for:**
1. **Employee Review Keyword Monitor**
   - Indeed/Glassdoor API or scraper
   - Flag reviews containing: "scheduling", "hours cut", "can't request off", "50+ hours"
   - Score by recency and severity

2. **Job Posting Language Analyzer**
   - Monitor Indeed/LinkedIn job postings
   - Flag urgency language: "start this week", "walk-in", "immediate"
   - Count simultaneous openings per restaurant

3. **Customer Review Staffing Mention Detector**
   - Yelp/Google review scraper
   - NLP to detect: "understaffed", "slow service", "staff said", "short staffed"
   - Weight by recency

4. **Corporate News Monitor**
   - RSS feeds: FSR Magazine, Nation's Restaurant News, Restaurant Business
   - Google Alerts: "[Chain name] + staffing" or "labor"
   - Track earnings call transcripts

5. **Expansion + Hiring Combo Alert**
   - Monitor: WhatNow, Eater, local business journals for opening announcements
   - Cross-reference with current job posting volume
   - Flag when [expansion announced] + [50+ openings]

### Level 3: AI-Powered Agentic Workflow (Future)

**Use the `restaurant-staffing-researcher` agent at scale:**
- Run overnight on top 100 priority restaurants
- Generate intelligence reports automatically
- Score and rank by signal strength
- Queue for human review/outreach

**Cost:** ~$0.50-2.00 per restaurant researched
**Time:** 5 minutes of agent runtime per restaurant
**Output:** Structured evidence + quotes + pain score

## SIGNAL DECAY & TIMING WINDOWS

Not all signals last forever. **Timing matters.** ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Always check dates!**

| Signal | Urgency Window | Decay Rate | Max Age to Use |
|--------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| Walk-in interviews | 1-4 weeks | Fast (once filled, signal gone) | 2 weeks - verify still active |
| "Start this week" language | 2-6 weeks | Fast | 1 month - check posting date |
| CEO public acknowledgment | 1-3 months | **FAST** (awareness fades) | **3-6 months MAX** - check article date |
| Job posting volume | 2-8 weeks | Fast-Medium | 1 month - recheck count |
| Customer reviews (staffing) | 3-6 months | Medium | 6 months - filter by review date |
| Employee reviews (scheduling) | 6-12 months | Medium | 12 months - filter by review date |
| Expansion announcement | 3-12 months | Slow (implementation lead time) | Use opening date for timing |
| Multiple GM turnovers | Evergreen | Slow (pattern over time) | 2 years - shows pattern |
| 50+ hour week mentions | Evergreen | Slow (ongoing) | 12 months - chronic issue |
| High turnover mentions | Evergreen | Slow (systemic) | 12 months - chronic issue |

### ⚠️ RECENCY RULES

**Before using ANY signal in outreach:**

1. **Check the date** - When was this written/published?
2. **Apply max age** - Is it within the "Max Age to Use" window?
3. **Verify if needed** - For fast-decay signals, re-verify they're still active
4. **Filter reviews** - When scraping reviews, filter by date range

### 🚫 STALE SIGNAL EXAMPLES (Don't Use!)

**Bad Example 1:**
- Signal: Golden Corral CEO said "most difficult time in 40-year career"
- Article date: October 2021
- Age: 3+ years old
- **Status: STALE - DO NOT USE**

**Bad Example 2:**
- Signal: Chuy's corporate acknowledged "labor scheduling improvements" needed
- Article date: August 2018
- Age: 6+ years old
- Context: They already implemented something in 2018!
- **Status: STALE - DO NOT USE**

### ✅ FRESH SIGNAL EXAMPLES (Good to Use!)

**Good Example 1:**
- Signal: Flower Child job posting "Apply today and start THIS WEEK"
- Checked: November 2025
- Age: Current
- **Status: FRESH - USE IMMEDIATELY**

**Good Example 2:**
- Signal: Employee review "scheduling is a constant battle"
- Review date: October 2024
- Age: 1 month old
- **Status: FRESH - USE IN OUTREACH**

**Good Example 3:**
- Signal: 1,035 job openings on Indeed
- Checked: November 28, 2025
- Age: Current
- **Status: FRESH - USE IMMEDIATELY**

**Implication:** Prioritize fast-decay signals first (walk-ins, urgency language), then nurture slow-burn signals (chronic complaints). **ALWAYS check dates before using in outreach.**

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

**Why These Are Alpha Signals:**

1. **Manual Effort Required**
   - Most competitors use automated lead gen (ZoomInfo, Clearbit, LinkedIn Sales Nav)
   - Reading employee review content takes human time
   - Not (yet) commoditized by data vendors

2. **Domain-Specific**
   - "Scheduling is a constant battle" only matters for scheduling software
   - Generic sales tools won't flag this
   - Competitors selling POS systems or kitchen tech don't care

3. **Timing Precision**
   - "Start this week" = right now
   - "Opening Plano Q1 2025" = 3-6 month window
   - Better than "they're a restaurant" (no timing signal)

4. **Conversation Starters**
   - "I noticed your employees mention scheduling is a constant battle" > "I see you're hiring"
   - Shows you did homework
   - Immediate credibility

5. **Scalable with AI**
   - First-mover advantage: build scrapers/agents now
   - By the time competitors catch up, you have relationships
   - Continuously find new signal types
