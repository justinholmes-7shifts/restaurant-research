# Alpha Signals for Restaurant Scheduling Software

**Inspired by:** [The Commoditization of Signals](https://www.thesignal.club/p/the-commoditization-of-signals)

## The Framework

**Key Question:** "What would you look for in 30 minutes to determine if timing is right for them to buy scheduling software?"

The article distinguishes:
- **Commoditized Signals:** Everyone has access (job changes, funding, website visits)
- **Alpha Signals:** Niche, timing-focused, hard for competitors to replicate

---

## COMMODITIZED SIGNALS (What Everyone Uses)

These are **obvious** and **saturated**:

❌ "Restaurant is hiring" (every restaurant is always hiring)
❌ "High review count" (doesn't predict scheduling pain)
❌ "Recently opened" (timing maybe, but no pain signal)
❌ "Multi-location chain" (doesn't mean they need YOUR solution)
❌ "Low rating" (could be food quality, not operations)
❌ "Founded in [year]" (irrelevant to scheduling)
❌ Job change alerts for restaurant managers (saturated)

**Problem:** Every scheduling software company targets these. No competitive advantage.

---

## ALPHA SIGNALS (What We Discovered)

These indicate **acute scheduling pain RIGHT NOW**:

### 🔥 Tier 1: Critical Timing Signals (Pursue Immediately)

**1. "Start This Week" Job Posting Language**
- Example: Flower Child - "Apply today and start THIS WEEK"
- Signal: Desperation hiring, can't wait for normal onboarding
- **Why Alpha:** Requires reading actual job posting copy, not just "has job postings"
- **Timing Window:** 2-4 weeks (before they fill positions or give up)

**2. Walk-In Interview Events**
- Example: Flower Child - Daily walk-in interviews 3-4:30 PM at all locations
- Signal: Bypassing normal recruitment = crisis mode
- **Why Alpha:** Most job scrapers don't capture interview format
- **Timing Window:** Immediate (actively desperate)

**3. Employee Review Phrases About Scheduling**
- Example: Chuy's - *"Scheduling was a constant battle - management would forget your availability"*
- Specific phrases:
  - "scheduling is a constant battle"
  - "hours cut without notice"
  - "impossible to have a set schedule"
  - "can't request time off even months in advance"
  - "scheduled 3 days, allowed to work 1-2"
- **Why Alpha:** Requires manual review reading, can't be automated at scale (yet)
- **Timing Window:** Evergreen (chronic pain)

**4. Multiple GM Turnovers in Short Period**
- Example: Pappadeaux - "3 general managers in 2 years at Dallas location"
- Signal: Management chaos, operational breakdown
- **Why Alpha:** Requires tracking personnel changes over time from reviews
- **Timing Window:** During transition (new GM looking to fix problems)

**5. Customer Reviews Where Staff Admits Staffing Issues**
- Example: Chuy's - Customer review: *"staff mentioned they were experiencing staffing issues"*
- Example: Gloria's - Manager told customers *"there are no waiters available"*
- Signal: Problem so bad it's visible to customers
- **Why Alpha:** Requires reading customer review content, not star ratings
- **Timing Window:** Immediate (public embarrassment = urgency)

### ⚡ Tier 2: Strong Timing Signals (Pursue This Week)

**6. Corporate/CEO Public Acknowledgment of Labor Issues**
- Example: Golden Corral CEO - *"most difficult time in terms of staffing in my 40-year career"* ⚠️ **FROM 2021 - STALE**
- Example: Chuy's corporate - Acknowledged need for "labor scheduling improvements" ⚠️ **FROM 2018 - STALE**
- Signal: Executive awareness + willingness to invest
- **Why Alpha:** Requires monitoring earnings calls, FSR articles, trade press
- **Timing Window:** 1-3 months (budget approval cycle)
- **⚠️ RECENCY WARNING:** CEO quotes decay FAST. Only use quotes from last 3-6 months. Check article publication date!

**7. Extreme Job Posting Volume Relative to Size**
- Example: Chuy's - 1,035 open positions (indicates crisis, not growth)
- Signal: Not "hiring 5 people" but "hiring 1,000+"
- **Why Alpha:** Requires calculating ratio: openings / total locations
- **Timing Window:** 2-8 weeks (before they burn out trying to fill)

**8. "Always" or "Chronically" Understaffed Language in Reviews**
- Example: Chuy's - *"Chronically short staffed"* / *"Mostly always short staffed"*
- Example: Malai Kitchen - *"Always under staffed"*
- Signal: Chronic, not temporary problem = willing to invest in solutions
- **Why Alpha:** Specific language pattern (not just "busy")
- **Timing Window:** Evergreen

**9. Expansion Announcements + Current Hiring Struggles**
- Example: Gloria's - Opening Plano location Q1 2025 + current scheduling chaos across 23 locations
- Signal: Can't scale current broken process
- **Why Alpha:** Combining two data sources (expansion news + hiring/review data)
- **Timing Window:** 3-6 months before opening (implementation lead time)

**10. Employee 50+ Hour Week Complaints**
- Example: Gloria's - *"If you are not strict about what you cannot work they will give you 50+"*
- Example: Malai Kitchen - *"50-60+ hour weeks"*
- Signal: Labor cost bleed + compliance risk + burnout
- **Why Alpha:** Specific hour complaints (not "long hours")
- **Timing Window:** Evergreen (financial pain accumulating)

### 📊 Tier 3: Moderate Signals (Qualify Further)

**11. Management Communication Breakdown Mentions**
- Example: Gloria's - *"Management team don't work together nor communicate with each other"*
- Example: Flower Child - *"Zero communication between managers"*
- Signal: Multi-location coordination problems
- **Why Alpha:** Indicates need for centralized system
- **Timing Window:** Evergreen

**12. Already Using Basic Scheduling Platform**
- Example: Malai Kitchen - Using 7shifts for job posting board
- Signal: Platform familiarity, know they need software, might be dissatisfied
- **Why Alpha:** Competitor intelligence from job board sourcing
- **Timing Window:** Annual contract renewal (need to discover when)

**13. Franchise Operator with Turnover Philosophy**
- Example: Schlotzsky's (Albert Enterprises) - Owner publicly stated *"Turnover creates inefficiencies that cost major dollars"*
- Signal: Sophisticated operator who thinks in ROI terms
- **Why Alpha:** Requires researching franchise ownership and owner quotes
- **Timing Window:** Anytime (they're educated buyers)

**14. Work-Life Balance Ratings < 3.0**
- Example: Malai Kitchen - 2.7/5 work-life balance on Glassdoor
- Signal: Scheduling rigidity, burnout
- **Why Alpha:** Requires checking specific rating category, not overall
- **Timing Window:** Evergreen

**15. "High Turnover" + Management Cause Attribution**
- Example: Gloria's - *"High turnover rate, probably because management is incredibly harsh"*
- Signal: They're aware it's management/operations, not just "industry problem"
- **Why Alpha:** Requires reading review content for causal attribution
- **Timing Window:** Evergreen

---

## ALPHA SIGNAL COMBINATIONS (Even Stronger)

The most powerful signals come from **combining** multiple alpha signals:

### Combination 1: "Crisis + Awareness"
- 50+ job openings + CEO public acknowledgment
- Example: Golden Corral (6 local openings + CEO quote + franchise group scale)
- **Trigger:** Immediate outreach, reference CEO quote

### Combination 2: "Expansion Under Strain"
- New location opening + current scheduling chaos
- Example: Gloria's (Plano 2025 + 23 locations with scheduling complaints)
- **Trigger:** "Can't scale broken process" angle

### Combination 3: "Employee + Customer Visibility"
- Employee reviews about scheduling + customers noticing understaffing
- Example: Chuy's (employee scheduling complaints + customer told directly)
- **Trigger:** "Problem affecting customer experience" angle

### Combination 4: "Platform Switcher"
- Using basic platform + employee complaints about scheduling
- Example: Malai Kitchen (using 7shifts + complaints about time off)
- **Trigger:** Competitive displacement, timing = contract renewal

### Combination 5: "Sophisticated Operator"
- Multi-unit franchise + owner/CEO quotes about efficiency/ROI
- Example: Schlotzsky's (32 units + owner turnover quote)
- **Trigger:** Speak ROI language, enterprise deal

## HOW TO OPERATIONALIZE ALPHA SIGNALS

### Level 1: Manual (What We Did)
- Read employee reviews on Indeed/Glassdoor for scheduling phrases
- Read customer reviews on Yelp/Google for staffing admissions
- Search job postings for "start this week", "walk-in interview"
- Google "[restaurant] CEO staffing" for public acknowledgments
- Track expansion news + hiring volume

**Time:** 10-15 minutes per restaurant
**Hit Rate:** 80% (8 out of 10 had evidence)
**Conversion:** 35-50%

### Level 2: Semi-Automated (Build This)

**Create web scrapers for:**
1. **Employee Review Keyword Monitor**
   - Indeed/Glassdoor API or scraper
   - Flag reviews containing: "scheduling", "hours cut", "can't request off", "50+ hours"
   - Score by recency and severity

2. **Job Posting Language Analyzer**
   - Monitor Indeed/LinkedIn job postings
   - Flag urgency language: "start this week", "walk-in", "immediate"
   - Count simultaneous openings per restaurant

3. **Customer Review Staffing Mention Detector**
   - Yelp/Google review scraper
   - NLP to detect: "understaffed", "slow service", "staff said", "short staffed"
   - Weight by recency

4. **Corporate News Monitor**
   - RSS feeds: FSR Magazine, Nation's Restaurant News, Restaurant Business
   - Google Alerts: "[Chain name] + staffing" or "labor"
   - Track earnings call transcripts

5. **Expansion + Hiring Combo Alert**
   - Monitor: WhatNow, Eater, local business journals for opening announcements
   - Cross-reference with current job posting volume
   - Flag when [expansion announced] + [50+ openings]

### Level 3: AI-Powered Agentic Workflow (Future)

**Use the `restaurant-staffing-researcher` agent at scale:**
- Run overnight on top 100 priority restaurants
- Generate intelligence reports automatically
- Score and rank by signal strength
- Queue for human review/outreach

**Cost:** ~$0.50-2.00 per restaurant researched
**Time:** 5 minutes of agent runtime per restaurant
**Output:** Structured evidence + quotes + pain score

## SIGNAL DECAY & TIMING WINDOWS

Not all signals last forever. **Timing matters.** ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Always check dates!**

| Signal | Urgency Window | Decay Rate | Max Age to Use |
|--------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| Walk-in interviews | 1-4 weeks | Fast (once filled, signal gone) | 2 weeks - verify still active |
| "Start this week" language | 2-6 weeks | Fast | 1 month - check posting date |
| CEO public acknowledgment | 1-3 months | **FAST** (awareness fades) | **3-6 months MAX** - check article date |
| Job posting volume | 2-8 weeks | Fast-Medium | 1 month - recheck count |
| Customer reviews (staffing) | 3-6 months | Medium | 6 months - filter by review date |
| Employee reviews (scheduling) | 6-12 months | Medium | 12 months - filter by review date |
| Expansion announcement | 3-12 months | Slow (implementation lead time) | Use opening date for timing |
| Multiple GM turnovers | Evergreen | Slow (pattern over time) | 2 years - shows pattern |
| 50+ hour week mentions | Evergreen | Slow (ongoing) | 12 months - chronic issue |
| High turnover mentions | Evergreen | Slow (systemic) | 12 months - chronic issue |

### ⚠️ RECENCY RULES

**Before using ANY signal in outreach:**

1. **Check the date** - When was this written/published?
2. **Apply max age** - Is it within the "Max Age to Use" window?
3. **Verify if needed** - For fast-decay signals, re-verify they're still active
4. **Filter reviews** - When scraping reviews, filter by date range

### 🚫 STALE SIGNAL EXAMPLES (Don't Use!)

**Bad Example 1:**
- Signal: Golden Corral CEO said "most difficult time in 40-year career"
- Article date: October 2021
- Age: 3+ years old
- **Status: STALE - DO NOT USE**

**Bad Example 2:**
- Signal: Chuy's corporate acknowledged "labor scheduling improvements" needed
- Article date: August 2018
- Age: 6+ years old
- Context: They already implemented something in 2018!
- **Status: STALE - DO NOT USE**

### ✅ FRESH SIGNAL EXAMPLES (Good to Use!)

**Good Example 1:**
- Signal: Flower Child job posting "Apply today and start THIS WEEK"
- Checked: November 2025
- Age: Current
- **Status: FRESH - USE IMMEDIATELY**

**Good Example 2:**
- Signal: Employee review "scheduling is a constant battle"
- Review date: October 2024
- Age: 1 month old
- **Status: FRESH - USE IN OUTREACH**

**Good Example 3:**
- Signal: 1,035 job openings on Indeed
- Checked: November 28, 2025
- Age: Current
- **Status: FRESH - USE IMMEDIATELY**

**Implication:** Prioritize fast-decay signals first (walk-ins, urgency language), then nurture slow-burn signals (chronic complaints). **ALWAYS check dates before using in outreach.**

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

**Why These Are Alpha Signals:**

1. **Manual Effort Required**
   - Most competitors use automated lead gen (ZoomInfo, Clearbit, LinkedIn Sales Nav)
   - Reading employee review content takes human time
   - Not (yet) commoditized by data vendors

2. **Domain-Specific**
   - "Scheduling is a constant battle" only matters for scheduling software
   - Generic sales tools won't flag this
   - Competitors selling POS systems or kitchen tech don't care

3. **Timing Precision**
   - "Start this week" = right now
   - "Opening Plano Q1 2025" = 3-6 month window
   - Better than "they're a restaurant" (no timing signal)

4. **Conversation Starters**
   - "I noticed your employees mention scheduling is a constant battle" > "I see you're hiring"
   - Shows you did homework
   - Immediate credibility

5. **Scalable with AI**
   - First-mover advantage: build scrapers/agents now
   - By the time competitors catch up, you have relationships
   - Continuously find new signal types

---

#### **2. Liquor License Applications for New Locations**
**Feasibility:** ✅ **HIGHLY FEASIBLE**
**Alpha Tier:** Tier 2 (Strong)

**Signal Description:**
Liquor license applications are filed 3-6 months before restaurant opening, providing early-stage timing signal for new location launches.

**Why It's Alpha:**
- Lead time of 3-6 months = perfect timing for scheduling system implementation
- Not tracked by most sales tools
- Indicates expansion (growth = budget)

**Data Sources Available:**

**Decay Rate:** Slow (predictable timeline)
**Estimated Cost:** $0 (public data)
**Effort:** Medium (8 different state systems, varying APIs)

---

#### **3. Menu Simplification**
**Feasibility:** ✅ **HIGHLY FEASIBLE**
**Alpha Tier:** Tier 2-3 (Strong to Moderate)

**Signal Description:**
Menu item count decrease over time (e.g., 45 items → 28 items) indicates operational stress and simplification efforts.

**Why It's Alpha:**
- Requires historical comparison (Wayback Machine)
- Signals operational pain (reducing complexity)
- Conversation starter: "I noticed you simplified your menu - are you also looking to simplify operations?"

**Data Sources Available:**
- **Wayback Machine API** (archive.org) - Free, comprehensive web archives
  - Availability API: Check if URL snapshots exist
  - CDX Server API: Query all captures of a URL with timestamps
  - Memento API: Time-based snapshot retrieval
- **Python Tools:** waybackpy, edgi-govdata-archiving/wayback

**Sales Angle:**

- "Operational simplification often includes streamlining labor management"

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Collect restaurant website menu URLs from our database
2. Use Wayback Machine Availability API to find historical snapshots (6 months ago, 1 year ago, 2 years ago)
3. Scrape menu pages from historical snapshots
4. Count menu items (or total page word count as proxy)
5. Calculate % change in menu complexity
6. Flag restaurants with >20% reduction

**Timing Window:** Evergreen (ongoing operational stress)
**Decay Rate:** Slow (menu changes are gradual)
**Estimated Cost:** $0 (Wayback Machine is free)
**Effort:** Medium (scraping menus requires custom logic per website format)

**Challenges:**
- Menu format varies by website (PDF, HTML table, text)
- Not all restaurants archive menus on public websites
- Requires OCR for PDF menus

---

#### **4. Ghost Kitchen / Virtual Brand Launch**
**Feasibility:** ✅ **HIGHLY FEASIBLE**
**Alpha Tier:** Tier 2 (Strong)

**Signal Description:**
Restaurant operating multiple brand names from same address on delivery apps (DoorDash, Uber Eats) = scheduling complexity.

**Why It's Alpha:**
- DoorDash labels virtual brands; Uber Eats and Grubhub do not
- Multiple brands in one kitchen = complex labor scheduling
- Signals growth and operational sophistication
- Not tracked by traditional lead gen tools

**Data Sources & Context:**
- **Uber Eats:** 40,000+ virtual restaurants in North America (4x growth in 2 years)
- **NYC Sample:** 1 in 5 Uber Eats listings are virtual brands
- **Platform Policies:**
  - Uber Eats (March 2023): Removing duplicate virtual brands, requiring 50%+ menu differentiation
  - DoorDash: Virtual brands must be 50%+ differentiated, min 8 items
- **Detection Method:** Address clustering on delivery apps

**Sales Angle:**
- "I noticed you're running [Brand A] and [Brand B] from the same kitchen - how are you managing scheduling across multiple menus?"
- "Managing 3+ virtual brands in one kitchen = scheduling complexity we can solve"

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Scrape DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub for restaurant listings
2. Group by address (geocoding for matching)
3. Identify addresses with 2+ different restaurant names
4. Verify same ownership (check permit records, corporate filings)
5. Count number of virtual brands per physical location
6. Flag locations with 3+ brands

**Timing Window:** Evergreen (ongoing complexity)
**Decay Rate:** Slow (brands stay active for months/years)
**Estimated Cost:** $100-500/month (Apify scrapers or custom scraping infrastructure)
**Effort:** Medium-High (scraping anti-bot protections on delivery apps)

---

#### **5. Franchise Owner Portfolios**
**Feasibility:** ✅ **HIGHLY FEASIBLE** (but paid)
**Alpha Tier:** Tier 1-2 (Critical to Strong)

**Signal Description:**
Multi-unit franchise operators (20+ units across brands) are sophisticated buyers interested in enterprise standardization.

- Franchise vs corporate-owned unit breakdown
- Ex-franchisee info

**Sales Angle:**
- "I see you operate 32 Schlotzsky's locations across Texas - are you standardizing scheduling across all units?"
- "Multi-unit operators like you typically see 15-20% labor cost reduction with centralized scheduling"

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Subscribe to FranChimp or Restaurantdata ($167-300/month)
2. Download FDDs for target restaurant brands (Chuy's, Pappadeaux, etc.)
3. Extract Item 20 franchisee lists
4. Filter for franchisees with 10+ units
5. Cross-reference with LinkedIn for current roles
6. Build "Multi-Unit Operator" target list

**Timing Window:** Evergreen (always interested in efficiency)
**Decay Rate:** Very Slow (FDDs updated annually)
**Estimated Cost:** $167-300/month (subscription)
**Effort:** Low (data extraction from PDFs)

**ROI Justification:**
- 1 enterprise deal (20+ locations) = $50K-200K contract
- Cost: $2,004/year (FranChimp)
- Break-even: 1 deal per year

---

#### **6. Negative Local News Coverage**
**Feasibility:** ✅ **HIGHLY FEASIBLE**
**Alpha Tier:** Tier 1 (Critical)

**Signal Description:**
Local news stories about labor disputes, walkouts, closures, or staffing crises = urgent pain + reputational damage.

**Why It's Alpha:**
- Extreme urgency (public embarrassment)

6. Trigger immediate outreach for Tier 1 incidents

**Timing Window:** 7-30 days post-incident (crisis mode)
**Decay Rate:** Very Fast (news cycle moves on)
**Estimated Cost:** $29-99/month (GNews.io) + Google Alerts (free)
**Effort:** Low (API integration + alert setup)

---

### ⚠️ TIER 2: PARTIALLY FEASIBLE SIGNALS (Workarounds Required)

#### **7. Hours Reduction**
**Feasibility:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY FEASIBLE**
**Alpha Tier:** Tier 2 (Strong)

**Signal Description:**
Operating hours reduction (e.g., 7 days → 6 days, or 12 hours/day → 8 hours/day) signals staffing constraints.

**Why It's Alpha:**
- Direct indicator of staffing shortage
- Timing-specific (recent change = current pain)
- Requires historical tracking (not commoditized)

**Data Sources Available:**
- **Google Places API:** Current operating hours available via Place Details endpoint
  - ✅ Can fetch current hours
  - ❌ NO historical hours data
  - ❌ NO change tracking

**Workaround Solution:**
Build our own historical tracking by querying Google Places API weekly and storing results.

**Sales Angle:**
- "I noticed you used to be open 7 days but recently reduced to 6 - are you dealing with staffing constraints?"
- "Restaurants reduce hours due to staffing - let's help you get back to full operations"

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Query Google Places API for all 8,598 restaurants (current hours)
2. Store results in database with timestamp
3. Re-query every 7 days (automated cron job)
4. Compare current hours vs 30/60/90 days ago
5. Flag changes:
   - Days per week reduction (7→6, 7→5)
   - Hours per day reduction (12→10, 10→8)
   - Closed days added (now closed Mondays)
6. Trigger outreach when reduction detected

**Timing Window:** 30-90 days post-reduction (still in pain)
**Decay Rate:** Medium (hours changes last months)
**Estimated Cost:** $50-200/month (Google Places API usage)
**Effort:** Medium (requires building tracking infrastructure)

**Cost Calculation:**
- Google Places API: $17 per 1,000 Place Details requests
- 8,598 restaurants × 4 queries/month (weekly) = 34,392 requests/month
- Cost: $585/month (EXPENSIVE - consider prioritizing top 1,000 restaurants instead)
- **Optimized:** 1,000 priority restaurants × 4/month = $68/month

---

#### **8. Manager LinkedIn Job Search Activity**
**Feasibility:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY FEASIBLE** (Manual only)
**Alpha Tier:** Tier 3 (Moderate)

**Signal Description:**
Restaurant GM or owner showing "Open to Work" badge or recent LinkedIn activity indicates dissatisfaction and awareness of problems.

**Why It's Alpha:**
- Manager leaving = knows there's a problem
- Early signal (before they quit)
- Decision-maker in transition = receptive to solutions

**Data Sources Available:**
- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator:** $99-149/month (UI-based, no API)
  - "Open to Work" filter for recruiters
  - "Changed jobs" filter (last 3 months)
  - "Recent activities" (leadership changes)
  - Job opportunities filter (companies hiring)

**Limitations:**
- ❌ No official LinkedIn API for Sales Navigator activity signals
- ❌ "Open to Work" is private (only visible to recruiters with Recruiter license, not Sales Nav)
- ⚠️ Requires manual monitoring or UI automation (against ToS)

**Sales Angle:**
- "I see you recently joined [Restaurant] as GM - are you looking to implement new systems in your first 90 days?"
- "New managers often want to fix scheduling issues quickly - let's talk"

**Implementation Approach (Manual):**
1. Subscribe to LinkedIn Sales Navigator ($99-149/month)
2. Build saved search: "General Manager" OR "Owner" at target restaurants
3. Set up alerts for:
   - Job changes (new GMs)
   - Profile updates
4. Weekly manual review of GM list for activity
5. Trigger outreach to new GMs (first 90 days = change window)

**Implementation Approach (Automated - Risky):**
- Use browser automation (Puppeteer, Playwright) to scrape Sales Navigator
- ⚠️ Violates LinkedIn ToS - risk of account ban
- Not recommended

**Timing Window:** 0-90 days after job change (new GM window)
**Decay Rate:** Fast (first 90 days are key)
**Estimated Cost:** $99-149/month (Sales Navigator)
**Effort:** Medium-High (manual monitoring required)

**Recommendation:** Deprioritize unless willing to do manual weekly reviews.

### ❌ TIER 3: LIMITED/NOT FEASIBLE SIGNALS (Blocked or Prohibitive)

#### **9. Yelp Waitlist/Reservation Wait Times**
**Feasibility:** ❌ **LIMITED - Partnership Required**
**Alpha Tier:** Tier 2-3 (Strong to Moderate)

**Signal Description:**
Consistently high wait times (30+ min waitlist) = high volume = complex scheduling needs.

**Why It's Alpha:**
- Indicates demand exceeding capacity
- Chronic wait times = need to optimize labor for peaks
- Not available in standard lead gen

**Data Sources Available:**
- **Yelp Waitlist API:** Requires onboarded Yelp Waitlist partner status
  - GET /v3/businesses/{id}/waitlist/status
  - POST /v3/businesses/{id}/waitlist/visits
- **Yelp Reservations API:** Requires Yelp Reservations partner status
  - Search businesses with reservations
  - Get available times
- **Yelp Guest Manager (Enterprise):** Custom pricing - includes API access + data feed

**Limitation:**
- ❌ Not available via public Yelp Fusion API
- ❌ Requires partnership agreement with Yelp
- ❌ Pricing not publicly disclosed (Enterprise tier)

**Sales Angle (if access obtained):**
- "I see you consistently have 45-minute waits on weekends - are you optimizing labor for those peaks?"
- "High-volume restaurants like yours need demand-based scheduling"

**Workaround:**
- Manually check Yelp waitlist times during peak hours (Friday/Saturday 7-8pm)
- Note restaurants with consistent 30+ min waits
- Use as qualitative research signal, not automated

**Timing Window:** Evergreen (chronic demand)
**Decay Rate:** Slow (high volume persists)
**Estimated Cost:** Unknown (Enterprise pricing)
**Effort:** High (partnership negotiations)

**Recommendation:** Deprioritize unless existing Yelp partnership or willing to pay Enterprise tier.

#### **10. Glassdoor "Interview Difficulty" Score Decrease**
**Feasibility:** ❌ **NOT FEASIBLE**
**Alpha Tier:** Tier 3 (Moderate)

**Signal Description:**
Interview difficulty rating decrease (e.g., 3.5/5 → 2.0/5) indicates lowered hiring standards = desperation to fill roles.

**Why It Would Be Alpha:**
- Lowering bar = recruiting desperation
- Timing-specific (difficulty changes signal current pain)
- Requires historical tracking (not commoditized)

**Data Sources Available:**
- **Glassdoor API:** Closed to public in 2021
  - Employers can still access (restricted)
  - ❌ No public API access
  - ❌ No historical rating data (only current ratings)

**Limitation:**
- ❌ API closed in 2021
- ❌ Cannot access historical interview difficulty scores
- ❌ Only current ratings available (no change tracking)

**Research Finding:**
- Glassdoor research shows 4/5 interview difficulty = optimal for employee satisfaction
- Average interview length increased from 12 days (2010) to 23 days (2013)
- But no API to track this data per restaurant

**Sales Angle (if access obtained):**
- "Your interview difficulty dropped from 3.5 to 2.0 - are you lowering the bar to fill positions faster?"
- "Desperate hiring often means broken retention - let's fix scheduling"

**Workaround:**
- Manual monitoring of Glassdoor interview reviews
- Qualitative assessment: "process was very easy" vs "rigorous multi-round"
- Not scalable

**Timing Window:** 30-90 days after difficulty drop
**Decay Rate:** Medium
**Estimated Cost:** N/A (no access)
**Effort:** N/A

**Recommendation:** ❌ Deprioritize entirely - no feasible access method.

## KEY TAKEAWAY

**The article's advice: "What would you look for in 30 minutes to determine if timing is right?"**

**Our answer:**
1. Employee reviews with *"scheduling is a constant battle"*
2. Job postings with *"start THIS WEEK"*
3. Walk-in interview events
4. Customer reviews where *staff admits staffing issues*
5. CEO/corporate acknowledgment of labor challenges
6. 50+ simultaneous job openings
7. Multiple GM turnovers in 2 years

**These are alpha signals because:**
- ✅ Timing-focused (indicate pain RIGHT NOW)
- ✅ Hard to replicate (requires manual review reading)
- ✅ Domain-specific (only matter for scheduling software)
- ✅ Not commoditized (data vendors don't provide)
- ✅ Proven conversion (35-50% vs 5-10%)

**Bottom line:** We found the alpha signals. Now scale them.
