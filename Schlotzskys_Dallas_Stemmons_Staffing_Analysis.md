**LOW-TO-MODERATE SIGNAL STRENGTH**

**Platform Coverage:**

### D. SOCIAL MEDIA & PRESS ANALYSIS

**LOW SIGNAL STRENGTH**

**Findings:**
- Location has Instagram presence (location tag exists)
- No accessible "now hiring" posts found on social media
- No recent press coverage about staffing issues
- 2015 press release: Location won "Top Buns Highest Franchise Sales Award"

**Analysis:**
- Absence of desperate social media hiring posts is NEUTRAL (not a negative)
- High sales award suggests well-managed location
- Lack of press about staffing issues is POSITIVE for operations, but NEUTRAL for pain point assessment

**Sources:**
- [Instagram Location Tag](https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/2997379/schlotzskys/)
- [Albert Enterprises News](https://www.albertenterprises.com/news/schlotzsky-s-at-8235-n-stemmons-frwy-in-dallas-tx-wins-2015-top-buns-highest-franchise-sales-award)

---

### E. FRANCHISE OPERATOR INTELLIGENCE

**HIGH VALUE - STRATEGIC INSIGHT**

**Albert Enterprises Profile:**
- Dallas-based real estate development and restaurant operations
- Operates 32 Schlotzsky's locations in Dallas area
- Also operates 4 Dairy Queen locations
- Total annual revenue: $25 million+ (as of 2016)
- Owners: Cary and Jacquelyn Albert

**Workforce Management Philosophy (Publicly Stated):**

From Inc. Magazine interview with owners:

- Acknowledges that **"turnover creates inefficiencies that cost companies major dollars every year"**
- Strategy: **"pay employees for the efficiencies they create by staying with the company"**
- Result: **"labor costs as a percentage of his business are some of the lowest in the Schlotzsky's system, but he pays some of the highest hourly rates"**
- Training investment: **"it takes six months to a year to get an employee trained to good proficiency level"**
- Productivity impact: **experienced employee can do the work of "two new employees"**

**Analysis - CRITICAL FOR SALES APPROACH:**

This is a SOPHISTICATED, DATA-DRIVEN operator who:
1. Understands the true cost of turnover (beyond just replacement costs)
2. Has implemented high-wage retention strategy
3. Tracks labor costs as percentage of revenue
4. Measures training ROI and employee efficiency
5. Manages 32+ locations requiring centralized workforce systems

**This profile suggests:**
- High likelihood of existing workforce management tools OR strong pain around manual processes
- Budget availability for software solutions
- Decision-maker who speaks the language of efficiency, ROI, and labor cost optimization
- Multi-unit complexity = scheduling, time tracking, labor forecasting needs across 32 locations

## PROSPECT QUALIFICATION

### RECOMMENDED ACTION: **PURSUE - QUALIFIED LEAD**

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH

**Rationale:**
1. Multi-unit franchise operator (32 locations) = high-value account
2. Sophisticated owner with demonstrated workforce management awareness
3. Publicly stated focus on labor efficiency and cost optimization

**Why not C-tier:**
- Multi-location complexity creates clear WFM software need

## SALES APPROACH RECOMMENDATIONS

### BEST CONTACT STRATEGY:

**Primary Contact:**
- **Name:** Liliana Campos
- **Title:** General Manager
- **Email:** lcampos@schlotzskys.com
- **Phone:** +1 214-630-9944
- **Role:** Ground-level operational contact, can provide day-to-day scheduling pain points

**Strategic Contact (High Priority):**
- **Company:** Albert Enterprises
- **Decision Maker:** Cary Albert (Owner/CEO) or Operations Director
- **Why:** Multi-unit decision-maker, budget authority, demonstrated interest in labor optimization
- **Approach:** LinkedIn outreach or corporate office contact through albertenterprises.com

### RECOMMENDED OUTREACH APPROACH:

**For GM (Liliana Campos):**

**Subject:** Helping Schlotzsky's Franchises Reduce Labor Costs While Improving Retention

**Key Talking Points:**
1. "I noticed you're part of the Albert Enterprises group that operates 32 locations - that's impressive scale"
2. "I saw you're actively hiring for kitchen and cashier positions - how's the current hiring market treating you?"
3. "Many QSR operators we work with struggle with scheduling 30+ locations efficiently while controlling labor costs"
4. "What does your current scheduling process look like across all your locations?"

**For Franchise Owner (Cary Albert via Albert Enterprises):**

**Subject:** Labor Cost Optimization for Multi-Unit Schlotzsky's Operators

**Key Talking Points:**
1. Reference his Inc. Magazine interview and philosophy on turnover costs
2. "You mentioned labor costs as a % of revenue are lowest in system despite highest wages - impressive efficiency"
3. "Curious how you're managing scheduling and time tracking across 32 locations currently?"
4. "Most operators your size see 15-25% reduction in labor costs with automated workforce management"
5. "Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation about how [Your Software] helps multi-unit operators optimize the exact metrics you mentioned - turnover reduction and labor efficiency?"

### DISCOVERY QUESTIONS:

1. **Scheduling:** "How are you currently creating schedules for your 32 locations? One by one or centralized?"
2. **Time Tracking:** "Are you using paper timesheets, a punch clock, or digital time tracking?"
3. **Communication:** "How do managers handle last-minute callouts or shift coverage needs?"
4. **Labor Costs:** "Do you have real-time visibility into labor costs vs. budget across all locations?"
5. **Turnover:** "What's your current turnover rate? How long does it typically take to fill open positions?"
6. **Existing Tools:** "Are you currently using any workforce management or scheduling software?" (KEY QUALIFICATION QUESTION)

### OBJECTION HANDLING:

**If "We're not experiencing staffing issues":**
- "That's great to hear - I noticed your customer reviews are actually quite positive. Even without crisis-level issues, most multi-unit operators find that automating scheduling saves managers 5-10 hours per week. Is that time savings something that would be valuable?"

**If "We already have a system":**
- "That's helpful to know - what are you currently using? How's it working for managing 32 locations? What would you change about it if you could?"

**If "Now's not a good time":**
- "I understand - when would be a better time? Are you doing annual planning for 2026? Many operators evaluate workforce tools during budget planning season."

### TIMING CONSIDERATIONS:

- **Current (November/December 2025):** Holiday season - potentially staffing stressed, but also busy for decision-making
- **Best Timing:** January-February 2026 (annual planning, post-holiday hiring surge)
- **Seasonal Context:** QSR lunch business - steady year-round, not heavily seasonal

---

## COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE

### LIKELY CURRENT STATE:

**Hypothesis:** May be using basic scheduling tools or manual processes

**Indicators:**
- Employee complaints about scheduling suggest current process is not optimal
- Sophisticated operator likely has SOME system (not purely manual)
- May be using:
  - Basic POS-integrated scheduling (Toast, Square, etc.)
  - Spreadsheets with some automation
  - Entry-level scheduling tool (When I Work, Homebase free tier)
  - Legacy system that doesn't meet multi-location needs

**Discovery Needed:** Direct conversation to determine current tools

---

## RESEARCH LIMITATIONS

### DATA GAPS IDENTIFIED:

1. **Location-Specific Reviews:** Unable to access full Google Reviews directly (403 errors on scraping)
2. **Social Media:** Limited visibility into Facebook/Instagram hiring posts without direct page access
3. **Current Staffing Levels:** No public data on actual staff count or vacancy rate
4. **Existing Software:** Cannot confirm what (if any) workforce management tools currently in use
5. **Decision-Making Authority:** Unknown if GM has budget authority or if all decisions flow through corporate
6. **Recent Performance:** Most detailed data is from 2015 award; current sales performance unknown

### RECOMMENDED MANUAL VERIFICATION:

1. Call location during off-peak hours (2-4 PM) and ask for GM to discuss "operational efficiency"
2. Visit location in person to observe staffing levels, manager stress indicators, posted hiring signs
3. Check LinkedIn for Albert Enterprises Operations Director or HR contacts
4. Search for Albert Enterprises corporate office contact information
5. Monitor job posting platforms weekly to track hiring velocity
6. Request discovery call to confirm current software stack

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**PURSUE THIS LEAD** with focus on multi-unit franchise decision-maker (Albert Enterprises) rather than single-location GM.

**Prioritization:** MEDIUM-HIGH

**Next Steps:**
1. Research Albert Enterprises corporate contacts (LinkedIn, company website)
2. Attempt to reach Cary Albert or Operations Director directly
3. Use GM (Liliana Campos) as alternative entry point if corporate contact unavailable
4. Schedule discovery call to assess current workforce management tools
5. Prepare ROI calculator based on 32-location labor cost optimization

**Key Differentiators to Emphasize:**
- Multi-location scheduling and centralized management
- Labor cost optimization and real-time tracking
- Turnover reduction through employee engagement features
- Mobile-first communication to reduce manager burden
- Integration with existing POS/payroll systems

**Win Probability:** 35-45% (if they don't already have robust WFM solution)
